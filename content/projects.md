## CASSINI.eu Hackathon (1st Edition) -- June 2021

<span style='text-align: justify;'>

Rodrigue participated in a team of four at the first CASSINI Hackathon. The theme of the hackathon was "_Digitalization of Green Spaces_". After three days, the team, named __SANDLESS__, presented their project to the French jury. SANDLESS won first prize and qualified for the European final.

To defend their project in the final, SANDLESS prepared a short video presentation and participated in a Q&A session with the European jury. After deliberation, SANDLESS achieved 3<sup>rd</sup> place in Europe and was awarded a 100-hour mentorship program with experts in Business and Marketing.

The mentorship program took place between September 2021 and February 2022. Under the supervision of Dany Robberecht and Benoit de Vrieze, SANDLESS followed the program with the following mentors: Carlos Bello Marcos (INNOVA4EU), Miguel Ángel López Trujillo (Lean Sales), Jasmina Ristic (Horizer), and Marco Poliafico (GE Renewable Energy).

## Big Data Project -- October 2018 to January 2019

<span style='text-align: justify;'>

During his Master’s program, Rodrigue participated in a pair in an inter-university competition (similar to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)) organized by the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (INSA) Toulouse in collaboration with Airbus Defence and Space. The objective was to develop a satellite image classification method to determine the presence or absence of wind turbines.
After four months of work, the team, named BumBumDATAm, achieved 7<sup>th</sup> place with an accuracy score of 97.7% (the winning team achieved 98.1%). The team was invited to INSA Toulouse to present their solution in front of other participants and organizers, including an image processing expert from Airbus Defence and Space.

    The team was particularly praised for the simplicity of their approach, given their final score.

<u>Team name</u>: BumBumDATAm.\
<u>Team members</u>: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigueg/" target="_blank"><b>Rodrigue Govan</b></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-siffre" target="_blank">Jason Siffre</a>.
