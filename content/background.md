## Professional

### Data Scientist (September 2020 to December 2020) -- ISEA, University of New Caledonia

<span style='text-align: justify;'>

Rodrigue was recruited as a Data Scientist at the Institute of Exact and Applied Sciences (ISEA), University of New Caledonia (UNC). He was assigned to the following project: Data analysis on freshwater and groundwater in New Caledonia.
For this project, Rodrigue applied various statistical methods to define a drinking water threshold specific to New Caledonia. In addition, he developed a graphical user interface to visualize all his analyses --including sampling maps and statistical tests-- with the aim of providing a decision-support tool.

During this period, Rodrigue also had the opportunity to join the Data Science research team. As a result, he contributed to the writing of two research papers, focusing respectively on time series analysis and image processing.

<u>Work environment</u>: Python (TensorFlow, scikit-learn, seaborn, Plotly, Dash, ...), Jupyter Notebook, QGIS, Microsoft Access, PostgreSQL.\

### Data Scientist Intern (February 2019 to August 2019) -- IDAIA Group, Bordeaux (France)

<span style='text-align: justify;'>

To complete his Master’s degree, Rodrigue completed a six-month internship at a small-to-medium enterprise (SME) specializing in data-driven marketing. He was assigned to a Deep Learning project, where he developed an object detection method based on Deep Learning techniques to identify residential swimming pools from satellite imagery.

During his internship, Rodrigue analyzed more than 200 million images (approximately 2TB of data). Thanks to his optimized algorithm, he successfully processed the entire dataset in two months instead of the initially estimated five years, earning praise from the company’s Research and Development team.

<u>Work environment</u>: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, seaborn, Plotly, ...), Jupyter Notebook framework, QGIS.\
