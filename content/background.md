## Professional

### Data Scientist (September 2020 to December 2020) -- ISEA, University of New Caledonia

<span style='text-align: justify;'>

Rodrigue got recruited at the ISEA laboratory as a Data Scientist. He got assigned to the following project: Analysis of freshwater and groundwater data in New Caledonia. During the project, Rodrigue used various statistic methods in order to define a threshold of potability of the water in New Caledonia. He also developed a user-friendly interface to visualize his analysis (including maps, statistical tests, PCA, ...).

During this period, Rodrigue also had the opportunity to integrate the Data Science research team. At the end, he got involved in two research publications (in Time Series Clustering and in Computer Vision).

<u>His work environment</u>: Python (Tensorflow, sklearn, seaborn, plotly, dash, ...), Jupyter notebook framework, QGIS, Microsoft Access.\

### Data Scientist Intern (February 2019 to August 2019) -- IDAIA Group, Bordeaux (France)

<span style='text-align: justify;'>

To validate his degree, Rodrigue did a 6-months internship in a data-driven marketing SME. He was assigned to a Deep Learning project. More specifically, Rodrigue had to create a Deep Learning based Object detection model to detect residential pools from satellite images. During the internship, Rodrigue had to process over 200M images (~2TB of data). With his optimized algorithms, he went from 5 years of expected processing to 2 months of processing, which was congratulated from the entire R&D staff.

<u>His work environment</u>: Python (Tensorflow, PyTorch, sklearn, seaborn, plotly, ...), Jupyter notebook framework, QGIS.\
